<p>One of the strengths of the VLN task is that, in contrast to other vision and language tasks such as image captioning, success is clearly measurable. Four evaluation outputs are provided. The leaderboard is ranked by Success Rate. </p>

<p><strong>Trajectory Length (length):</strong> The agent's mean trajectory length in metres. This is not a figure of merit, however it provides some context regarding the amount of exploring that an agent is undertaking (relative to the mean trajectory length of the shortest path oracle, for example).</p>

<p><strong>Navigation Error (error):</strong> The agent's mean navigation error in metres. We define navigation error as the shortest path distance in the simulator's navigation graph between the agent’s final position (i.e., disregarding heading and elevation) and the goal location. Note that we do not evaluate the agent’s entire trajectory as many instructions describe the location of the goal without specifying a particular path that must be taken to reach it.</p>

<p><strong>Success Rate (success):</strong> The agent's mean success rate in terms of reaching the goal location. We consider an episode to be a success if the agent's navigation error is less than 3m. This threshold allows for a reasonable margin of error in the context of an imprecise natural language navigation instruction, yet it is comfortably below the minimum starting error in the R2R dataset (which is 5m).  </p>

<p><strong>Oracle Success Rate (oracle success):</strong> The agent's mean success rate in the presence of an oracle stopping rule, i.e. if the agent magically stopped at the closest point to the goal on its trajectory. We consider stopping to be a fundamental aspect of completing the navigation task, demonstrating understanding, but also freeing the agent to potentially undertake further tasks at the goal. Nevertheless, we include this evaluation to disentangle the problem of recognizing the goal location from the other aspects of the task. </p>
