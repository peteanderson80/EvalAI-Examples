<p>One of the strengths of the VLN task is that, in contrast to other vision and language tasks such as image captioning, success is clearly measurable. Five evaluation outputs are provided, as described below. The primary evaluation metrics of interest are Success Rate (success), and Success rate weighted by normalized inverse Path Length (SPL). </p>

<p><strong>Trajectory Length (length):</strong> The agent's mean trajectory length in metres. This figure provides some context regarding the amount of exploring that an agent is undertaking (relative to the mean trajectory length of the shortest path oracle, for example), and is used in the calculation of SPL.</p>

<p><strong>Navigation Error (error):</strong> The agent's mean navigation error in metres. We define navigation error as the shortest path distance in the simulator's navigation graph between the agent’s final position (i.e., disregarding heading and elevation) and the goal location. The agent is expected to identify the goal location and stop as close as possible to it. We do not evaluate the agent’s entire trajectory as many instructions describe the location of the goal without specifying a particular path that must be taken to reach it.</p>

<p><strong>Oracle Success Rate (oracle success):</strong> The agent's mean success rate in the presence of an oracle stopping rule, i.e. if the agent magically stopped at the closest point to the goal on its trajectory. We consider stopping to be a fundamental aspect of completing the navigation task, demonstrating understanding, but also freeing the agent to potentially undertake further tasks at the goal. Nevertheless, we include this evaluation to disentangle the problem of recognizing the goal location from the other aspects of the task. </p>

<p><strong>Success Rate (success):</strong> The agent's mean success rate in terms of reaching the goal location. We consider an episode to be a success if the agent's navigation error is less than 3m. This threshold allows for a reasonable margin of error in the context of an imprecise natural language navigation instruction, yet it is comfortably below the minimum starting error in the R2R dataset (which is 5m).  </p>

<p><strong>Success rate weighted by (normalized inverse) Path Length (SPL):</strong> It is generally possible to improve the agent's Success Rate at reaching the goal by exploring more of the environment before committing to a decision. However, in a robotics context, longer trajectories have costs (battery, wear, delays for the user, etc). Further, humans can solve the VLN task with very short trajectories. Therefore, SPL trades-off Success Rate against Trajectory Length. SPL is defined in the arXiv paper <a class="blue-text" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06757">On Evaluation of Embodied Navigation Agents</a>. 

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>For the SPL calculation, it is imperative that submissions accurately account for the agent's trajectory. We advise all teams considering submitting to the leaderboard to read the Challenge Guidelines on the “Submit” tab (available only after logging in) well in advance of a planned submission. </p>
